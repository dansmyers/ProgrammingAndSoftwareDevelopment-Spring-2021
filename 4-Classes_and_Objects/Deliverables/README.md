# Classes and Objects &ndash; Deliverables

## Description

You have two projects to complete:

- An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, and **artificial life** simulation, that models the births and deaths of cells living on a 2-D grid. 
Life is the best-known example of a **cellular automaton** and is famous for the intricate patterns it can produce without human input.

- Blackjack, a classic example of object-oriented programming. The goal of this program is to illustrate how OOP can be used to **model the parts of
a program**.

The descriptions and starter code for the two projects are in the `Life` and `Blackjack` folders.

Both projects are likely to be more difficult that anything you have developed thus far. They both require you to write a non-trivial program made from the interaction of 
multiple classes.

- Take time to carefully read the descriptions and really understand the requirements for each problem.
 
- **Develop incrementally** and **test your code frequently as you develop**.
 
- **Start early**! Don't wait until the last minute. In particular, you should be able to write most of `Life` right away. We will develop two of the classes you need for `Blackjack`
in class.

## Grading

The `Life` project includes a driver class named `RunLife` that implements four automated patterns. You'll get one point for each pattern that your code successfully executes

- A simple three-square blinker that alternates between vertical and horizontal

- A glider, the iconic Life pattern that walks diagonally across the grid

- A more complex flashing pattern

- **Gosper's Glider Gun**, a pattern that produces an infinite stream of gliders. Named after Bill Gosper, who discovered it in 1970. The discovery of the Gun answered a challenge
from John Conway to find a pattern that could produce an infinite number of living cells and won Gosper a prize of $50.
