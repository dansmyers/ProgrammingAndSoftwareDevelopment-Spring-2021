## *“Once more search with me.” - The Merry Wives of Windsor: IV, ii*

We have been working on building a search engine for the plays of William Shakespeare, first as a stand-alone Java application and now as a web application using Java Spring Boot. You

**Front-End**

The front-end page is simple. Look at `index.html` as a starting point.

- Create a text box for the search word with a button to activate the search.
- On a button click, send an `XmlHttpRequest` to the server specifying the search word.
- The server processes the search and returns a JSON object containing the results.
- Use a `<div>` to display the search results. Apply some appropriate formatting.

**Back-End**

Most of the work will be on the back-end. Take a look at `app.js` as a starting point.

- I've given you some starter code that reads in the example texts. You need to add all of the additional text processing to extract the information
that you want from each line. 

- Write a route on the server that can receive a request from the front-end, extract the necessary information from the index structure, and
then return the results as in JSON format.

**Texts**

I've given you three examples files in the `texts` directory. To keep the scope reasonable, you only need to work with these three plays.
All of the lines in the example files have a regular structure.

- The name of the play will always be the first line of the file.
- The act and scenes will always be identified by ACT and SCENE appearing at the beginning of a line.
- Character names appear at the beginning of a line.
- Lines that continue a speech begun by a character are always indented by a single tab (\t).

Using these facts, you should be able to parse out the acts, scenes, and character names as you read through each line in the file.

No individual part of this project is very hard, but you need to tie together lots of different elements to create the full application.

Tips:

- Start early! Don't wait until the last minute.
- Develop incrementally! Make small changes and observe their effects. Don't write more than a few lines of code without testing it.
- Respect the asynchronous nature of Node: when working with callback functions, you generally can't guarantee that the callbacks execute in any particular
order.
