# Challenge Project: Deploy to Heroku

## Description

This project is to be completed after you finish the Search Engine project.

Suppose you want to deploy your finished Shakespeare search engine to the web so it can be publicly accessible? You have a few options:

- You could buy your own computer to use as a server, set it up to run your application and serve pages, connect it to the Internet, and configure a domain name to point to it.
